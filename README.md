0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

##According to the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, a stack is a linear data structure. The last item to be added to the stack will therefore be the one to be deleted first. You can only add or remove plates from the top of the stack of plates, so think of it that way. A stack's fundamental operations are as follows:

Push: Raising a stack piece to the top.
Pop: Taking the first item out of the stack.
peeking at the top part without taking it away.
isEmpty: Verifies whether the stack is empty.
Managing function calls and local variables in programming languages, adding undo capabilities to programs, and evaluating expressions using postfix notation—also called reverse polish notation—are examples of common uses for stacks.

Another linear data structure that adheres to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) rule is a queue. Similar to standing in line at a store or a ticket counter, the first item added to a queue is also the first one removed from it. Basic queue procedures include:

Enqueue: Placing anything at the end of the line.
Dequeue: To take the preceding element out of the queue.
Front: Observing the front component while leaving it in place.
isEmpty: Verifies whether the queue is empty.


The LIFO concept is the foundation of stack, which is used to manage elements where the last element added is the first to be removed.
The FIFO principle is the foundation of queue management, which is employed when the first element added is also the first one withdrawn.
Both stacks and queues are fundamental ideas in computer science that are used in several programming and computational contexts.
